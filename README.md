# Glib Chart Patterns Support Resistance Utilities

This code is a utility script developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team to enhance forex trading by identifying and displaying chart formations and support/resistance levels. It utilizes the MQL5 programming language and integrates various libraries and functions.

## Functionality

The script performs the following functions:

1. Calculates and displays chart formations: The script uses the CPattern library to calculate the probability of various chart formations, such as Double Top, Head and Shoulders, Ascending Triangle, etc. The probability is compared against a threshold value (PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD) and if it exceeds the threshold, the chart formation is displayed on the chart using CChartObjects.

2. Determines the stage of the pattern: The script includes a function (DeterminePatternStage) to determine the stage of the pattern based on certain logic. The specific logic for determining the stage is not mentioned in the code and needs to be implemented by the user.

3. Accesses trade-relevant information: The script includes a function (AccessTradeInformation) to access trade-relevant information. The logic for accessing this information is not mentioned in the code and needs to be implemented by the user.

## Usage

To use this utility script, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries and functions: The script includes necessary include statements to import the required libraries and functions from the MQL5 standard library.

2. Declare and initialize global variables: The script declares and initializes global variables, including CTrade for trading operations, CChartObjects for chart object operations, CPattern for chart formation calculations, and CSupportResistance for support/resistance operations.

3. Define constants: The script defines two constants, MAX_CHART_FORMATIONS and PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD, which can be adjusted according to the user's requirements.

4. Define chart formations: The script defines an array of chart formations (chartFormations) that will be calculated and displayed. Add or remove formations from this array as needed.

5. Implement CalculateChartFormations function: This function iterates through the chart formations array, calculates the probability of each formation using the CPattern library, and if the probability exceeds the threshold, displays the formation on the chart using CChartObjects.

6. Implement DeterminePatternStage function: This function should contain the logic to determine the stage of the pattern. The specific logic for determining the stage is not mentioned in the code and needs to be implemented by the user.

7. Implement AccessTradeInformation function: This function should contain the logic to access trade-relevant information. The specific logic for accessing this information is not mentioned in the code and needs to be implemented by the user.

8. Implement OnTick function: This is the main function of the script, which is executed on each tick. It calls the CalculateChartFormations function to calculate and display chart formations, calls the DeterminePatternStage function to determine the stage of the pattern, and calls the AccessTradeInformation function to access trade-relevant information.

## Product Description

The Glib Chart Patterns Support Resistance Utilities is a powerful utility script developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team to enhance forex trading. This script is designed to identify and display various chart formations and support/resistance levels, providing traders with valuable insights for making informed trading decisions.

With the Glib Chart Patterns Support Resistance Utilities, traders can easily identify chart formations such as Double Tops, Head and Shoulders, Ascending Triangles, and many more. The script calculates the probability of each formation and displays them on the chart, allowing traders to visually analyze the market and identify potential trading opportunities.

In addition to chart formations, the script also provides support/resistance functionality, allowing traders to identify key levels where the price is likely to reverse or stall. This information can be crucial for setting entry and exit points, as well as determining stop-loss and take-profit levels.
